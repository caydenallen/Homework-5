This script represents an ATM. If the user enters the PIN incorrectly three times the block def will run and exit the program. The verify def checks to see if the PIN is '1234'. The GetInput def checks to see if the user enters the correct amount of characters and if the user is enterting the correct character type and will display messages accordingly. the main def calls the the GetInput def.
